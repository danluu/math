WARNING: Boost MPI is BROKEN in 1.64.0; I used 1.65.1, but 1.65.0
seems to be OK as well, see here:
https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/12723

Install 1.65+ version of Boost with b2 and

Build boost serialization and boost mpi as shared libraries

./b2 --prefix=$HOME/local --with-mpi --with-serialization -j4 install

In make/local you need to set

BOOST=...path to you 1.65 boost...
CXX=mpicxx
CXXFLAGS+=-DSTAN_HAS_MPI
LDFLAGS+=-L...path to installed boost libs... -lboost_mpi -lboost_serialization

and ensure that the LDFLAGS finds the boost installation of mpi and serialization

... and of course, the openmpi implementation needs to be
available. The macports openmpi works great.

The use of mpicxx is recommended by openmpi, but not required. That is,
for openmpi you can find out the extra compiler flags needed for
linking to openmpi with the command.

mpicxx --showme

The mpicxx man page has more details on this.

The minimal tests are in

test/unit/math/rev/mat/functor

map_rect_mpi_test.cpp

These can be compiled the usual way. After
compilation they can be started with

mpirun -np 4 ./map_rect_mpi_test

with 4 cpus.
